Excercise A (4 p) Implement a class

We need to write an application, which reads two times (times are represented by two
integers: hours and minutes). Then the program finds out which time is later. After that it
calculates the time difference between these times.

Finally, the program displays the
smaller (earlier) time and the time difference (duration) in the format
starting time was 11:22
duration was 1:04
